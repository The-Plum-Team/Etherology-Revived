# Building Etherology Revived

The port uses a Stonecutter-managed common module and one loader module for Fabric and Forge. The
checked-in release matrix is the source of truth for Minecraft, loader, and Java versions.

## Current 1.20.1 branch

The active matrix declares exactly two Minecraft 1.20.1 release lanes:

| Gradle project | Loader | Java | Canonical source root |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `:common:1.20.1` | Shared code | 17 | `common/src/main` |
| `:fabric:1.20.1` | Fabric | 17 | `fabric/src/main` |
| `:forge:1.20.1` | Forge | 17 | `forge/src/main` |

The two loader rows are the release lanes; the common project supports both. The
Fabric lane currently compiles the ported canonical implementation under the root
`src/` tree together with its Fabric platform sources and the Stonecutter-generated
common sources. This is an explicit transition state while loader-neutral code is
moved into `common` by complete vertical slices.

Fabric 1.20.1 builds, generates data, and has passed its packaged Phase 0 E2E run
in a real macOS client and integrated world. Forge has a native JavaFML entry point,
metadata, and an accepted persistent ethereal-storage/menu core. Its release artifact
remains deliberately blocked first on storage parity, then on the explicitly declared
ethereal-channel/network milestone and broader gameplay work.

## Requirements

- A JDK 21 or newer to run Gradle 9.6.1. Gradle compiles the Minecraft modules for Java 17.
- Network access for the first dependency and toolchain resolution.
- Parallel Gradle execution disabled. The project property and commands below enforce this because
  Loom/Stonecutter configuration shares generated state between the loader nodes.

## Structural checks

List the complete Stonecutter project graph without compiling the mod:

```shell
bash ./gradlew --no-daemon --no-parallel projects
```

List root build and verification tasks:

```shell
bash ./gradlew --no-daemon --no-parallel tasks --group build
bash ./gradlew --no-daemon --no-parallel tasks --group verification
```

Build and test the current validated Fabric lane with:

```shell
bash ./gradlew --no-daemon --no-parallel \
  :common:1.20.1:test \
  :fabric:1.20.1:test \
  :fabric:1.20.1:build \
  :fabric:1.20.1:buildE2eHarness \
  :fabric:1.20.1:verifyE2eHarnessIsolation \
  validateSupportCatalog
```

Compile and unit-test the Forge bootstrap work without claiming a release artifact:

```shell
bash ./gradlew --no-daemon --no-parallel \
  :forge:1.20.1:test \
  :forge:1.20.1:compileJava \
  :forge:1.20.1:validateForgePersistentStorageMenuCoreMilestone \
  :forge:1.20.1:verifyForgePortGateClosed
```

The positive persistent-core task depends on both Common and Forge tests and therefore compiles
both source graphs before it inspects the Common JAR and compiled Forge classes. The final task is
diagnostic only: it reports the first incomplete forward milestone. It is not a release gate or a
substitute for the native Forge client/server and packaged E2E proof that has not run yet.

`buildAllLanes` is intentionally not yet a passing acceptance command: the Forge
`remapJar` task is fail-closed while that lane is incomplete. See
`docs/porting/FORGE-1.20.1-BOOTSTRAP.md` for its exact gate.

## Source ownership

- `common/src/main/java` and `common/src/main/resources` own loader-independent implementation as
  it is extracted by complete, tested vertical slices.
- `fabric/src/main/java` and `fabric/src/main/resources` own Fabric entry points and metadata.
- `forge/src/main/java` and `forge/src/main/resources` own Forge entry points and metadata.
- The root `src/main` and `src/client` trees temporarily remain canonical inputs to the Fabric lane;
  they are not Forge inputs.
- `common/src/test` owns future loader-independent tests.
- A version-specific compatibility overlay, if one becomes necessary, should be declared in
  `release/release-matrix.json` and use a narrow `common/src/legacy1_20_1` source root.

Stonecutter generates node-local sources under module `versions/` and `build/` directories. Do not
edit generated files; edit the canonical source roots and regenerate instead.
