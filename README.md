# Etherology Revived

Etherology Revived is a multi-version, multi-loader continuation of
[feytox/Etherology](https://github.com/feytox/Etherology). The repository uses
Stonecutter version branches with loader-neutral Common code and thin loader
modules. The exact branch, Java, loader, and API roadmap is tracked in
[`release/support-catalog.json`](release/support-catalog.json) and explained in
[`docs/porting/VERSION-MATRIX.md`](docs/porting/VERSION-MATRIX.md).

## Port status

| Minecraft | Loader | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.20.1 | Fabric | Active port; build, datagen, unit tests, and three real-client E2E slices pass; broader parity is pending |
| 1.20.1 | Forge | Active port; bounded Storage and Channel client E2E, shared sound resources, and the shared game-event registry with dedicated-server proof are accepted; the broader registry, network, and release gates remain closed |
| 1.21.1–1.21.11 | Fabric + NeoForge | Declared follow-up branches |
| 26.1, 26.1.1, 26.1.2, 26.2 | Fabric + NeoForge | Declared follow-up branches using the no-remap architecture |

Forge artifacts are intentionally blocked until the remaining gameplay,
client, native-loader, and E2E parity gates pass. See
[`BUILDING.md`](BUILDING.md), the
[`Forge 1.20.1 completion plan`](docs/porting/FORGE-1.20.1-COMPLETION-PLAN.md),
the frozen [Fabric 1.20.1 runtime evidence](docs/evidence/fabric-1.20.1/README.md),
and the bounded [Forge 1.20.1 runtime evidence](docs/evidence/forge-1.20.1/README.md).
The next Forge forward gate is the remainder of the authoritative registry
spine. Its bounded shared-sound and game-event steps are complete.
`SharedGameEvents` is the sole Common deferred owner of
`etherology:etherology_resonance`, whose internal ID is
`etherology_resonance` and whose range is 16. Both loaders package exact
membership in the vanilla `vibrations` and `warden_can_listen` tags. Fabric
uses its supported `SculkSensorFrequencyRegistry` hook for frequency 10; Forge
47 has no supported equivalent, so custom sculk-frequency behavior remains
deferred instead of being approximated.

The game-event step has both an exact cross-loader artifact gate and a real
Java 17 Forge dedicated-server run in the fresh repository-owned `v2`
Loom-userdev profile. That headless run passed all 31 registry, tag data-load,
full mod-inventory/isolation, and lifecycle assertions. The runner additionally
required a saved world, normal stop, and process exit code zero; the proof does
not need screenshots. No native sound-playback E2E is claimed yet—the
mechanics that consume each sound must prove playback. The earlier Fabric
`v20` packaged startup, integrated-world, screenshot, save, and normal-shutdown
smoke predates the game-event rebuild and therefore does not claim equality
with the current Fabric artifact. Frozen evidence archives prove only their
capture-time artifacts, so every later rebuilt JAR needs another isolated
native run before it can claim equivalent runtime evidence.

## Special thanks
It's no secret that this mod was inspired by another similar project - *Thaumcraft*. We respect Azanor's work for his wonderful work, and we aim to *rethink* many successful ideas of that time so that even years later you can return to that vast world.
