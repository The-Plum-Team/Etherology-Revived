# Etherology Revived

Etherology Revived is a multi-version, multi-loader continuation of
[feytox/Etherology](https://github.com/feytox/Etherology). The repository uses
Stonecutter version branches with loader-neutral Common code and thin loader
modules. The exact branch, Java, loader, and API roadmap is tracked in
[`release/support-catalog.json`](release/support-catalog.json) and explained in
[`docs/porting/VERSION-MATRIX.md`](docs/porting/VERSION-MATRIX.md).

## Port status

| Minecraft | Loader | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.20.1 | Fabric | Active port; build, datagen, unit tests, and three real-client E2E slices pass; broader parity is pending |
| 1.20.1 | Forge | Active port; bounded Ethereal Storage and Ethereal Channel foundation verticals accepted in native E2E; broader registry/network and release gates remain closed |
| 1.21.1–1.21.11 | Fabric + NeoForge | Declared follow-up branches |
| 26.1, 26.1.1, 26.1.2, 26.2 | Fabric + NeoForge | Declared follow-up branches using the no-remap architecture |

Forge artifacts are intentionally blocked until the remaining gameplay,
client, native-loader, and E2E parity gates pass. See
[`BUILDING.md`](BUILDING.md), the
[`Forge 1.20.1 completion plan`](docs/porting/FORGE-1.20.1-COMPLETION-PLAN.md),
the frozen [Fabric 1.20.1 runtime evidence](docs/evidence/fabric-1.20.1/README.md),
and the bounded [Forge 1.20.1 runtime evidence](docs/evidence/forge-1.20.1/README.md).
The next Forge forward gate is the authoritative registry spine, beginning with
shared sound registration. The frozen evidence archives prove their captured
artifacts only; later sources and rebuilt JARs require new isolated native runs.
