# Etherology Revived

Etherology Revived is a multi-version, multi-loader continuation of
[feytox/Etherology](https://github.com/feytox/Etherology). The repository uses
Stonecutter version branches with loader-neutral Common code and thin loader
modules. The exact branch, Java, loader, and API roadmap is tracked in
[`release/support-catalog.json`](release/support-catalog.json) and explained in
[`docs/porting/VERSION-MATRIX.md`](docs/porting/VERSION-MATRIX.md).

## Port status

| Minecraft | Loader | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.20.1 | Fabric | Active port; build, datagen, unit tests, and three real-client E2E slices pass; broader parity is pending |
| 1.20.1 | Forge | Active port; bounded Storage and Channel client E2E, shared sound resources, the shared game-event/loot-condition registry foundation, and Common-owned Ether-source reload behavior with dedicated-server proof are accepted; the broader registry, network, and release gates remain closed |
| 1.21.1–1.21.11 | Fabric + NeoForge | Declared follow-up branches |
| 26.1, 26.1.1, 26.1.2, 26.2 | Fabric + NeoForge | Declared follow-up branches using the no-remap architecture |

Forge artifacts are intentionally blocked until the remaining gameplay,
client, native-loader, and E2E parity gates pass. See
[`BUILDING.md`](BUILDING.md), the
[`Forge 1.20.1 completion plan`](docs/porting/FORGE-1.20.1-COMPLETION-PLAN.md),
the frozen [Fabric 1.20.1 runtime evidence](docs/evidence/fabric-1.20.1/README.md),
and the bounded [Forge 1.20.1 runtime evidence](docs/evidence/forge-1.20.1/README.md).
The next Forge forward gate is the remainder of the authoritative registry
spine. Its bounded shared-sound, game-event, loot-condition, and Ether-source
reload-listener steps are complete.
`SharedGameEvents` is the sole Common deferred owner of
`etherology:etherology_resonance`, whose internal ID is
`etherology_resonance` and whose range is 16. Both loaders package exact
membership in the vanilla `vibrations` and `warden_can_listen` tags. Fabric
uses its supported `SculkSensorFrequencyRegistry` hook for frequency 10; Forge
47 has no supported equivalent, so custom sculk-frequency behavior remains
deferred instead of being approximated. `SharedLootConditions` is likewise the
sole Common deferred owner of
`etherology:random_chance_with_fortune`, backed by the canonical
`RandomChanceWithFortuneConditionSerializer` on both loaders.

Common is now the sole implementation and resource owner for the
`EtherSourceLoader` server-data listener and its default `ether_sources` data.
The accepted Java 17 Forge 47.4.9 dedicated-server run used the fresh
repository-owned `etherology-e2e-forge-server-1.20.1-v6` profile and a real
`reload` command. Report schema 4 passed all 72 ordered assertions: the initial
map contained exactly 23 entries, including corrected
`etherology:primoshard_rella = 4` and `minecraft:redstone = 2`, while the
enabled probe pack produced exactly 24 entries with
`minecraft:redstone = 9.5` and added `minecraft:diamond = 13`. The game-event
registry and tags remained stable. The loot-condition registry and evaluated
behavior also remained stable even though Minecraft correctly replaced the
probe `LootTable` instance during reload. The server saved the world, stopped
normally, exited with code zero, and logged no `ERROR` or `FATAL` marker.
Because this was a headless dedicated-server scenario, it produced no
screenshots. The immutable archive is
[`ether-source-reload-server-v6`](docs/evidence/forge-1.20.1/ether-source-reload-server-v6),
with profile-manifest SHA-256
`2e6b937169d7bf8d765d181de93837371fb32940b31a480f5fde9620d96d21f0`,
server-log SHA-256
`0be91a9c231e12d00066a2924ba755820da0a8be9f3ef654bb243a375ee5628f`,
and archive-manifest SHA-256
`6d552536f74c018ce56e238fcb5a3aacd8fa363c76293863514adf9d7bafc2e0`.

This bounded proof does not establish furnace or machine consumption, the
wider Ether network, the full authoritative registry, native sound playback,
Forge custom sculk-frequency behavior, Attrahite drops, or release readiness.

The historical registry foundation has both exact cross-loader artifact gates and a real
Java 17 Forge 47.4.9 dedicated-server run in the fresh repository-owned
`etherology-e2e-forge-server-1.20.1-v4` Loom-userdev profile. The headless
`registry-foundation` run passed 39 of 39 assertions. Separately, all 63 Python
runner and evidence safety tests pass. The run proved the sole game event and its two tags, the
sole Fortune-scaled condition type and serializer, and a synthetic table whose
sorted outputs were `[minecraft:gold_ingot, minecraft:stone]` for an empty tool and
`[minecraft:diamond, minecraft:gold_ingot, minecraft:stone]` for Fortune I, including the mixed
`0.99 + 0.01` case. It also saved the world, stopped normally, exited with code
zero, and contained no `ERROR` or `FATAL` marker. This server-only proof creates
no screenshots.

The canonical Attrahite loot-table resource remains Fabric-only because its
items have not been ported. The synthetic table proves the shared condition and
serializer, not Attrahite gameplay or drop parity. The historical v2
game-event archive is retained, but the frozen `registry-foundation-server-v4`
archive superseded it as the registry-foundation proof and is now retained
alongside the current v6 Ether-source reload proof. Native sound playback and Forge's custom sculk frequency remain
deferred. The earlier Fabric `v20` packaged client evidence predates this
registry rebuild and does not claim equality with the current Fabric artifact.
Frozen archives preserve capture-time observations and payload integrity; the
current-artifact gates are separate. Every later rebuilt JAR needs another
isolated native run before it can claim equivalent runtime evidence.
